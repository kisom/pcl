## '(practical common lisp)

this is just the code to support working through the book

it is in the form of literate code, i.e. comments are used heavily to 
document what is going on.

the source for the book is: http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/

note that because this is literate code, there are chapters where the
vast bulk of the source file is comments. for example, chapter 4
currently has 143 lines, but only two of those evaluate. (there are
120 lines of comments and 23 blank lines.)
